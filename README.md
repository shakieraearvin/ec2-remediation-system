# üöÄ EC2 Monitoring and Remediation System  
*ServiceNow Implementation for Netflix DevOps*

---

## üìå System Overview
This project delivers a **semi-automated incident response system** that helps Netflix‚Äôs DevOps team quickly detect and remediate failing AWS EC2 instances.  

When an EC2 instance fails:  
‚úÖ The **AWS Integration Server** updates ServiceNow every minute with instance status.  
‚úÖ **Flow Designer** triggers on `status = OFF` to:  
- Create an **incident record**  
- Run **AI Search** to retrieve Knowledge Base guidance  
- Send a **Slack notification** with remediation steps  

‚úÖ Engineers can then use a **one-click remediation button** in ServiceNow to call the AWS Integration Server API and restart the instance.  
‚úÖ Every attempt is recorded in the **Remediation Log table** for auditing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **AWS EC2** ‚Äì Cloud infrastructure powering Netflix‚Äôs services  
- **AWS Integration Server** ‚Äì Health monitoring + API gateway for remediation  
- **ServiceNow Scoped Application** ‚Äì EC2 Monitoring & Remediation (scope: `x_snc_ec2_monito_0`)  
- **ServiceNow Flow Designer** ‚Äì Automated workflows for incidents, AI Search, and Slack notifications  
- **ServiceNow UI Action & Script Include** ‚Äì One-click remediation (`Trigger EC2 Remediation` + `EC2RemediationHelper`)  
- **AI Search** ‚Äì Intelligent knowledge retrieval for remediation guidance  
- **Slack Webhooks** ‚Äì Real-time DevOps notifications  
- **Custom Tables** ‚Äì `EC2 Instance` + `Remediation Log`  
- **System/HTTP Logs** ‚Äì Audit trail of incidents, API calls, and remediation attempts

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps
1. **Scoped Application Setup**  
2. **Custom Tables** (EC2 Instance + Remediation Log)  
3. **AWS Integration Configuration**  
4. **UI Action & Script Include Setup**  
5. **Flow Designer Workflow** (Trigger on OFF status)  
6. **Knowledge Base Article Creation**

## üîß Optimization
- Enabled **AI Search Logging** for transparency  
- Implemented **audit trail** with System Logs + HTTP Logs  
- Used **Force Save** in Flow Designer to capture all workflow components  
- Removed **Slack webhook token** before publishing to GitHub for security

## üë®‚Äçüíª DevOps Usage
1. **Monitor EC2 Status** (EC2 Instance table)  
2. **Receive Notifications** (Slack alerts + Incident creation)  
3. **Perform Remediation** (UI Action ‚Üí AWS API call)  
4. **Review Logs** (Remediation Log + System/HTTP logs)  
5. **Use Knowledge Base** (AI Search for remediation steps)
