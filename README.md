# üöÄ EC2 Monitoring and Remediation System  
*ServiceNow Implementation for Netflix DevOps*

---

## üìå System Overview
This project delivers a **semi-automated incident response system** that helps Netflix‚Äôs DevOps team quickly detect and remediate failing AWS EC2 instances.  

When an EC2 instance fails:  
‚úÖ The **AWS Integration Server** updates ServiceNow every minute with instance status.  
‚úÖ **Flow Designer** triggers on `status = OFF` to:  
- Create an **incident record**  
- Run **AI Search** to retrieve Knowledge Base guidance  
- Send a **Slack notification** with remediation steps  

‚úÖ Engineers can then use a **one-click remediation button** in ServiceNow to call the AWS Integration Server API and restart the instance.  
‚úÖ Every attempt is recorded in the **Remediation Log table** for auditing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **AWS EC2** ‚Äì Cloud infrastructure powering Netflix‚Äôs services  
- **AWS Integration Server** ‚Äì Health monitoring + API gateway for remediation  
- **ServiceNow Scoped Application** ‚Äì EC2 Monitoring & Remediation (scope: `x_snc_ec2_monito_0`)  
- **ServiceNow Flow Designer** ‚Äì Automated workflows for incidents, AI Search, and Slack notifications  
- **ServiceNow UI Action & Script Include** ‚Äì One-click remediation (`Trigger EC2 Remediation` + `EC2RemediationHelper`)  
- **AI Search** ‚Äì Intelligent knowledge retrieval for remediation guidance  
- **Slack Webhooks** ‚Äì Real-time DevOps notifications  
- **Custom Tables** ‚Äì `EC2 Instance` + `Remediation Log`  
- **System/HTTP Logs** ‚Äì Audit trail of incidents, API calls, and remediation attempts

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps
1. **Scoped Application Setup**  
2. **Custom Tables** (EC2 Instance + Remediation Log)  
3. **AWS Integration Configuration** (Credentials, HTTP Connection, Connection Alias)  
4. **UI Action & Script Include Setup**  
5. **Flow Designer Workflow** (Trigger on OFF status, Incident Creation, AI Search, Variables, Slack Message)  
6. **Knowledge Base Article Creation**  
7. **Validation with Logs** (Remediation Log + Outbound HTTP Logs)

## üîß Optimization
- Enabled **AI Search Logging** for transparency  
- Implemented **audit trail** with System Logs + HTTP Logs  
- Used **Force Save** in Flow Designer to capture all workflow components  
- Removed **Slack webhook token** before publishing to GitHub for security

## üë®‚Äçüíª DevOps Usage
1. **Monitor EC2 Status** (EC2 Instance table)  
2. **Receive Notifications** (Slack alerts + Incident creation)  
3. **Perform Remediation** (UI Action ‚Üí AWS API call)  
4. **Review Logs** (Remediation Log + System/HTTP logs)  
5. **Use Knowledge Base** (AI Search for remediation steps)

## üì∏ Screenshots

### 1. Application Setup  
![Application Setup](screenshots/application_setup.png)  
*Created a scoped application named **EC2 Monitoring and Remediation**. This ensures the scope (`x_snc_ec2_monito_0`) is generated correctly for AWS Integration compatibility.*

---

### 2. Table Structure ‚Äì EC2 Instance & Remediation Log  
![EC2 Instance Table](screenshots/ec2_table.png)  
*EC2 Instance table auto-populated by the AWS Integration Server every minute with instance IDs and ON/OFF status.*  

![Remediation Log Table](screenshots/remediation_log.png)  
*Custom Remediation Log table tracks remediation attempts, including request payloads, response payloads, HTTP status codes, and success/failure flags.*

---

### 3. AWS Integration Configuration  
![AWS Credentials](screenshots/aws_credentials.png)  
*Created credentials for authenticating with the AWS Integration Server.*  

![AWS Connection](screenshots/aws_connection.png)  
*Configured the connection record with hostname and base path to connect ServiceNow with AWS.*  

![AWS Alias](screenshots/aws_alias.png)  
*Set up Connection & Credential Alias for consistent referencing across the scoped app.*

---

### 4. UI Action and Script Include  
![UI Action](screenshots/ui_action.png)  
*UI Action ‚ÄúTrigger EC2 Remediation‚Äù added to the EC2 Instance form, enabling one-click remediation.*  

![Script Include](screenshots/script_include.png)  
*Script Include `EC2RemediationHelper` handles backend logic and makes the API call to AWS.*

---

### 5. Flow Designer Workflow  
![Flow Designer](screenshots/flow_designer.png)  
*Flow Designer workflow triggers when EC2 status = OFF. It creates an incident, runs AI Search, and sends Slack notifications.*  

#### 5a. Flow Trigger  
![Flow Trigger](screenshots/flow_trigger.png)  
*Trigger configuration: executes the workflow when an EC2 instance record status changes to OFF.*  

#### 5b. Set Flow Variables  
![Set Variables](screenshots/set_variables.png)  
*Defines and stores variables for use across the workflow.*  

#### 5c. Message Step  
![Message Step](screenshots/message_step.png)  
*Sends a Slack message to DevOps with incident details and knowledge article links.*  

---

### 6. AI Search Integration  
![AI Search Custom](screenshots/ai_search_custom.png)  
*Configured and tested the AI Search Custom action in Flow Designer. Initially returned no articles, which highlighted the need to create a Knowledge Base article in Step 7.*

---

### 7. Knowledge Base Article  
![Knowledge Base Article](screenshots/knowledge_base_article.png)  
*Created a knowledge article with remediation instructions. This ensures AI Search can retrieve guidance during incident workflows.*

---

### 8. Incident Record  
![Incident Record](screenshots/incident_record.png)  
*Automatically generated incident record whenever an EC2 instance is marked as OFF.*

---

### 9. Slack Notification  
![Slack Notification](screenshots/slack_notification.png)  
*Slack notification automatically posted to DevOps channel with incident details and remediation guidance.*

---

### 10. Logs and Validation  
![System & HTTP Logs](screenshots/outbound_http_logs.png)  
*System/HTTP logs confirm API calls, remediation attempts, and responses from AWS.*  

![Remediation Logs](screenshots/remediation_log.png)  
*Final validation in the Remediation Log table showing successful remediation attempts.*
